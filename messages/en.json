        "title": "Refrigeration",
        "lead1": "Refrigeration is a branch of technology that deals with processes of lowering and maintaining low temperatures in enclosed spaces. The primary goal of refrigeration is to remove heat from a given environment to cool it down. It covers a wide range of applications, from simple cooling systems like refrigerators and air conditioners to more complex industrial solutions such as cold storage rooms or cooling systems in production processes. The main objectives of refrigeration are not only to lower the temperature but also to control humidity and maintain optimal conditions for storing goods such as food or medicine.",

        "title": "Ventilation",
        "lead": "Ventilation is the process of exchanging air in rooms to remove pollutants, excess moisture, carbon dioxide, and other undesirable substances, as well as to supply fresh air from outside. Ventilation improves indoor air quality, enhancing the comfort and health of occupants while helping to maintain appropriate temperature and humidity levels. Ventilation systems can operate naturally (e.g., through windows or ventilation grilles) or mechanically (e.g., fans, recuperators, or air handling units).",  
        "lead2": "Mechanical ventilation uses devices such as fans to force air circulation. It is divided into supply ventilation, which delivers fresh air to the room, and exhaust ventilation, which removes used air. Mechanical ventilation systems are often more efficient and can be integrated with heating or air conditioning systems.",
        "listLead": "Proper mechanical ventilation is necessary to ensure a high level of comfort in rooms. When selecting a ventilation system, it is important to:",
        "listItem1": "Choose the right fan efficiency for the given room.",

        "lead1": "Air conditioning has become an integral part of daily life worldwide. It allows for thermal comfort through personalized operation tailored to individual customer needs. Modern air conditioners not only cool but also offer heating, dehumidification, and air purification functions. Depending on the room type, air conditioning systems can vary. The most popular are wall-mounted air conditioners, but there are also cassette, ducted, ceiling-mounted, and console units available on the market.",
